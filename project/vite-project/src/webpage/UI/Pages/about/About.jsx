          Fastrack was launched in 1998 and became an independent urban youth
          brand in 2005. Since then, it has carved a niche for itself with
          watches and sunglasses that are both fashionable and affordable.
          Fastrack extended its footprint into accessories in 2009 with a range
          of bags, belts and wallets. Fastrack retails across the nation through
          158 exclusive Fastrack stores in over 79 cities as well as authorized
          multi-brand outlets and online (www.fastrack.in). Today, the brand has
          successfully notched up the title of being the most loved youth
          fashion brand in the country.

        <h5>Fastrack’s DNA</h5>
        <p>
          If Fastrack was to be described in a single word, ‘Irreverent’ would
          be it. Not the insolent, sacrilegious or rude variety, but more the
          cheeky anti-authoritarian kind. This is evident in the brand’s edgy,
          provocative and tongue-in-cheek advertising. A brand that questions
          everything, pushes boundaries, constantly re-invents and never strays
          near the beaten path. Fastrack has earned the tag of being
          ‘Effortlessly Cool’. For them it boils down to not taking things too
          seriously, they flip the bird at having to be acceptable and smile
          sardonically in the face of all the haters. Stemming from the need to
          keep their audience engaged and at the edge of their seats, Fastrack
          has developed the innate ability to switch tracks and constantly
          reinvent. The brand is ‘Unpredictable’, and always has a trick up its
          sleeve. The ideal of being ‘Eternally Young’ is a concept that
          Fastrack identifies with and lives by, every day. It is straddling
          that thin red line between adolescent and adulthood and it is staying
          right there. Fastrack’s permanent subscription to the fountain of
          youth is an integral base in its DNA strand as progression is infinite
          when you are forever young.
        </p>
        <h5>Fastrack’s Positioning</h5>
        <p>
          Fastrack is India’s foremost youth accessories brand. It is sporty and
          coed. It believes that it is all about range and delivers just that in
          almost ungodly quick cycles. The brand stays focused on its audience
          and delivers what they want before they even know they want it.
          Fastrack is accessible and owns the playing field. It is not cheap,
          just affordable. It is not just about fashion but rather, lifestyle.
          It does not make products that are meant to be collectibles or those
          that will turn into heirlooms. It does not just make watches. It is
          not the manufacturer of tween gear. Fastrack accessorizes the youth…
          it makes what is their war paint and marks of individualism; it
          represents, articulates and stands for all they have to say.
        </p>
        <h5>Move On</h5>
        <p>
          It’s Fastrack’s philosophy, its mantra, its battle cry. This simple
          phrase is the expression of the way the brand thinks, operates,
          communicates and works. It’s a blueprint for all that is Fastrack.
